# YouTubeDiscordPresnce for Windows
 - This is now the main branch that I'll probably use and clear up later (macOS is a bit annoying)
 - Editing the extension and ```main.cpp``` can be done in VSCode directly
 - Compiling ```main.cpp``` and creating the installer should be done in Visual Studio
## TODO
 - How to handle multiple tabs
 - Error with quotation marks in video title and author (appears as ```\"``` instead of ```"```)
 - Livestream and premeire support
## Instructions for Committing From a Terminal
 - Run ```git status``` to check if anything needs to be uploaded
 - Run ```git add .``` to prepare all the files for uploading
 - Run ```git commit -m [description]``` to describe the commit
 - Run ```git push``` to push the files into the repository
